## Code Snippets
![Code Ex](./Images/codeSnip1.png)

This snippet of code is how the page is initialized when `node index.js` is ran in the terminal. Inquirer prompts all questions in the questions array, then the answers are used to write the readme file. The file name is taken from the answers object with a key of title and the content is generated by sending the answers information to the generateMarkdown function.
